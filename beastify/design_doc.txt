Following the guide, we'll learn how to make web extensions for firefox from start to finish.
This particular tutorial extension adds a red border to "mozilla.org" pages or any of its subdomains.

Writing the extension:

make a folder named borderify
create a file name manifest.json inside this folder
instert this boilerplate into the manifest file:
    {
    "manifest_version": 2,
    "name": "Borderify",
    "version": "1.0",

    "description": "Adds a red border to all webpages matching mozilla.org.",

    "icons": {
        "48": "icons/border-48.png"
    },

    "content_scripts": [
        {
        "matches": ["*://*.mozilla.org/*"],
        "js": ["borderify.js"]
        }
    ]
    }

Create the "icons" folder directly under the "borderify" folder.
Save an icon there named "border-48.png". 
    If you choose to supply your own icon, It should be 48x48 pixels. 
    You could also supply a 96x96 pixel icon, for high-resolution displays, and if you do this it will be specified as the 96 property of the icons object in manifest.json:
        "icons": {
            "48": "icons/border-48.png",
            "96": "icons/border-96.png"
            }
    Alternatively, you could supply an SVG file here...
Finally, create a file called "borderify.js" directly under the "borderify" directory. Give it this content:
    document.body.style.border = "5px solid red";

Trying it out:
first check file paths/sturture is correct:
    borderify/
        icons/
            border-48.png
        borderify.js
        manifest.json

Installing:
    In Firefox: 
        Open the about:debugging page.
        Click the This Firefox option.
        Click the Load Temporary Add-on button.
        Then select any file in your extension's directory.
The extension now installs, and remains installed until you restart Firefox.
Alternatively, you can run the extension from the command line using the web-ext tool.

Testing:
Now visit a page under "https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/", and you should see the red border round the page.
Try experimenting a bit. 
Edit the content script to change the color of the border, or do something else to the page content.
Save the content script, then reload the extension's files by clicking the Reload button in "about:debugging".
You can see the changes right away.
